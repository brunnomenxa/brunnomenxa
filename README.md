### Live long and prosper ðŸ––
I'm an amateur astronomer, worldbuilder, programmer, UX/UI designer, 3D modeller, self-taught and avid reader. Perfectionist (always improve with a vision of quality). Metalhead.
Knowledge is the most valuable thing for me and hard science is my thing. I know a little of everything, but I'm *not* an expert in everything, every day I learn something new with the dream of unattainable encyclopedic knowledge. I'm the right person to have a deep conversation full of (not always good) puns that ends up in an existential crisis at dawn. Fan of Elite Dangerous and Star Trek.
Open mind always, no determinism. I hate clickbaits and knowledge quacks.
